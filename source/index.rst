Installing development versions
--------------------------------
ZotPie remains in development as of November 2015. Development Versions can be found on the GitHub dev branch. You
can also clone directly from a git enabled console by pasting: ``git clone http://github.com/repo``

Building Documentation
-----------------------
If you wish to build ZotPie's documentation for offline use, it can be built from the ``doc`` directory of a local git
repo by running ``make`` followed by the desired output format(s) (``html``, ``epub``, ``latexpdf``, etc.)

Batch Editing Tags 
===================
 This feature allows you to edit tags en masse, there are two ways to do this. The first is to open the batch editor (in Zotero) and then search for the tag you would like to change,delete,modify, or merge and click apply. The second is to manually add items to a batch editing queue and then open the batch editor and apply the changes to items in your queue.


Launching the Batch Tag Editor
----------------------------

#. Open Zotero (Firefox or Standalone)
#. Open the Batch Tag Editor by clicking on the Batch Tag Editor icon (see image below) |bedit_big|

The Batch Tag Editor GUI
--------------------------
Upon launching the Batch Tag Editor a window similar to the one below should pop up, see the glossary below the image for a detailed explanation of the functionality of each section in the Batch Tag Editor window. The Batch Adding tags functionality GUI is slightly different see the Batch Adding Tags section for more information.

|btedit_window|

**Legend: (refer to image above)**
	Find
		The **Find** text-box is where you would type a tag name in order to sort through the tags displayed in the
		**Original Tags** section.
	Replace
		The **Replace** text-box (applicable only when modifying tags) is where you specify a tag name that would replace all tags in the **Tags to be changed** box. Note that these changes are only applied after you press the **Apply** button.
	Original Tags
		The **Original Tags** box displays all of the tags that are currently attached to the items in your library, collection, or queue. Clicking an item in this box adds it to the **Tags to be Changed** box to the right.
	Tags to be Changed
		Items in this box will be modified or removed depending on the mode specified in the **Action** dropdown menu. Changes will only be applied to your library, collection, or queue after pressing **Apply**.
	Parameters: Type
		The type of field you would like to edit, currently ZotPie only supports tags so dont worry about this.
	Parameters: Action
		The action you would like to perform on the tags in the **Tags to be Changed** section.
			#. Modify will replace tags in the **Tags to be Changed** section with whatever is specified in the **Replace** section
			#. Remove will remove all tags in the *Tags to be Changed** section from your library, collection, or queue.
			#. Add - see the Batch Adding Tags section.
	Parameters: Scope
		The scope in which the changes you want will be applied. If set to **All** changes will be applied to your entire library, if you select a **Collection** changes will only be applied to items that collection, if you are using a queue you would select **Items**.

	Parameter: Collection
		If the scope is set to collection, this will let you select the collection you would like changes to be applied to.

.. warning::
	The batch editor does not backup any data before making changes, the only way to undo changes to your library made by the batch editor are:
		(a) backup your library before using the batch editor
		(b) use the batch editor again, with the tag parameters switch 

Adding Custom Fields
====================

The **Custom Field Editor** adds a new item field to a given item type in Zotero. For example, if you wanted to add the item field "gregorian date" to the item type "book", then the Custom Field Editor is a tool that could add "gregorian dates" in the custom field section of all  books in your library.

Launching the Custom Field Editor
---------------------------------
There are two methods for launching the Custom Field Editor:

**Method #1: Launch via. the Icon**
	#. Open Zotero (Firefox or Standalone)
	#. Click the Custom Field Editor icon (see image below)

	|cficotaskbar|

**Method #2: Launch via. an Item**
	#. Open Zotero
	#. Select any item in your library
	#. Click on the *Custom Fields* tab in the item's info pane
	#. Click Add

.. note::	
	
	Custom Data does not currently sync to your online Zotero Database, this functionality is still under development.
	
..	This feature is intended for organizational and aesthetic purposes only, custom fields will not sync to your online Zotero library as all custom data is stored in a local database. If you do not use the Zotero servers for syncing your library and instead use your own then it may be possible, with some tweaking, to have the custom database sync your data. This, however, should only be attempted by a developer - interested developers should see the `developer documentation <./index_dev.html>`_ for ZotPie.

Notes
=====
The ZotPie plugin applies all changes to your **local** Zotero library, If you do not have automatic syncing enabled you
will have to sync before changes to your library are applied on the Zotero servers.
