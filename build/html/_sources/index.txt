Description
============
ZotPie is a open source plugin for Zotero (Firefox) that was created to give members of the Zotero community several features that have been long overdue.

Welcome to ZotPie's documentation!
==================================
This is the user documentation for the ZotPie firefox plugin for Zotero. If you are a developer, you may be interested in the `developer documentation <./index_dev.html>`_.

Installing development versions
--------------------------------
ZotPie remains in development as of November 2015. Development Versions can be found on the GitHub dev branch. You
can also clone directly from a git enabled console by pasting: ``git clone http://github.com/repo``

Building Documentation
-----------------------
If you wish to build ZotPie's documentation for offline use, it can be built from the ``doc`` directory of a local git
repo by running ``make`` followed by the desired output format(s) (``html``, ``epub``, ``latexpdf``, etc.)

Batch Editing Tags 
===================
 This feature allows you to edit tags en masse, there are two ways to do this. The first is to open the batch editor (in Zotero) and then search for the tag you would like to change,delete,modify, or merge and click apply. The second is to manually add items to a batch editing queue :ref:`Batch Editing: brute force` and then open the batch editor and apply the changes to items in your queue.


Batch Editing: brute force
---------------------------

Batch Editing: using the queue
-------------------------------

.. warning::
	The batch editor does not backup any data before making changes, the only way to undo changes to your library made by the batch editor are:
		(a) backup your library before using the batch editor
		(b) use the batch editor again, with the tag parameters switch 

Adding Custom Fields
===================
#. Open Zotero (for Firefox)
#. todo

.. note::	
	
	Custom Data does not currently sync to your online Zotero Database, this functionality is still under development.
	
..	This feature is intended for organizational and aesthetic purposes only, custom fields will not sync to your online Zotero library as all custom data is stored in a local database. If you do not use the Zotero servers for syncing your library and instead use your own then it may be possible, with some tweaking, to have the custom database sync your data. This, however, should only be attempted by a developer - interested developers should see the `developer documentation <./index_dev.html>`_ for ZotPie.

Coupling Documents
===================
#. Open Zotero (for Firefox)

Citation Editor
===================
#. Open Zotero (for firefox)

Notes
=====
The ZotPie plugin applies all changes to your **local** Zotero library, If you do not have automatic syncing enabled you
will have to sync before changes to your library are applied on the Zotero servers.

Liscense
